# 🛒 Retail Data Analysis

This dataset contains household-level transactions over two years from a group 
of 2,500 households who are frequent shoppers at a retailer. It contains all of 
each household’s purchases, not just those from a limited number of categories. 
For households, demographic information as well as direct marketing contact 
history are included.
